    There are two types of unresolved values:
        Grid search: These define a grid search over values. For example, the
        following grid search values in a spec will produce six distinct
        variants in combination:
            "activation": grid_search(["relu", "tanh"])
            "learning_rate": grid_search([1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5])
        Lambda functions: These are evaluated to produce a concrete value, and
        can express dependencies or conditional distributions between values.
        They can also be used to express random search (e.g., by calling
        into the `random` or `np` module).
            "cpu": lambda spec: spec.config.num_workers
            "batch_size": lambda spec: random.uniform(1, 1000)
    Finally, to support defining specs in plain JSON / YAML, grid search
    and lambda functions can also be defined alternatively as follows:
        "activation": {"grid_search": ["relu", "tanh"]}
        "cpu": {"eval": "spec.config.num_workers"}
    Use `format_vars` to format the returned dict of hyperparameters.
